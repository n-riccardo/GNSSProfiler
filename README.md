**GNSSProfiler** is under development and was created with MATLAB App Designer.

You can run GNSSProfiler from source (Option 1) or install it as a MATLAB app (Option 2). Recommended MATLAB version is R2020a or newer.

**Option 1**

Add the GNSSProfiler folder to your path; in MATLAB, use:
```matlab
addpath(genpath('path/to/GNSSProfiler'))
```
Then launch the app with:
```matlab
run('GNSSProfilerApp.mlapp')
```
Alternatively, you can run the .m file:
```matlab
run('GNSSProfiler.m')
```

**Option 2**

If you do not want to modify the code, you can try the app by downloading only the ``.mlappinstall`` file (then double-click it to install). You will find GNSSProfiler in the Apps tab in MATLAB.

You can also create a new ``.mlappinstall`` file from the ``.mlapp``file. Open GNSSProfilerApp.mlapp with App Designer. Go to **Share-> Package App** to create a ``.mlappinstall`` file.
